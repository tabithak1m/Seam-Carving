# Seam-Carving

### ESC190 Project
The detailed description of the project can be found at: [Seam Carving Instructions](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/190/proj/proj2/handout/handout.html). 

Here, this project carves/cuts an image while being aware of the image content such that the size reduces while the major details of the image remain the same. The c_img.c, c_img.h, png2bin.py, and seamcarving.h files were provided by Professor Guerzoy where the code under seamcarving.c files' functions are written by me. These files along with a png file will be able to demonstrate a successful seam-cutting instance.
